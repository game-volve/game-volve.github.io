        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
            I've always loved Metroidvanias, everything from
            <a class="orangeBg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Fusion">Metroid: Fusion</a> to
            <a class="orangeBg" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/350070/Environmental_Station_Alpha/">Environmental Station Alpha</a>.
            So I was excited when my friend told me about this game I'd like. That game was
            <a class="orangeBg" href="https://dead-cells.com/">Dead Cells</a> and oh man have I enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dead Cells is a 2D action platformer that draws inspiration from Castlevania and Dark Souls, so you can
            expect a lot of enemies, exploration, and dying - permadying.
        </p>

        <h3>What is permadeath?</h3>
        <p>
            But before I get carried away, I want to define permadeath, to make sure that we're all on the same
            page. Now the name is quite the giveaway; permadeath is a mechanic in games that means once you die,
            you die for good, no checkpoints and no saves. It's been around for a long time, most coin op games
            used permadeath to monetise games.
        </p>
        <p>
            So while the mechanic itself is quite simple, the problem with permadeath is that if it's done wrong,
            the game will become real boring real quick. Every action will seem worthless, and every task will feel
            monotonous. So just how has Motion Twin (The developers) made Dead Cells so enjoyable and replayable?

        <h3>More than a mechanic</h3>
        <p>
            I think the first step in making permadeath work is understanding just how important it is. I've seen a
            lot of games throw permadeath in as an additional challenge without much thought, only to have the mode
            fail because the developers didn't scale the challenge properly. Looking at you Ghost Mode from
            <a class="orangeBg" href="http://bit.ly/2GCRQds">Ghost Recon Wildlands</a>
            which clearly wasn't planned well.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can clearly see that Motion Twin planned out permadeath carefully. The best example being the other
            mechanics in the game;
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Every time you die, the whole map will be re arranged. At first I though the gameplay would suffer
            from a randomly generated map. Traditionally, Metroidvanias tend to have hand crafted maps, they're
            usually very elaborate and hide many secrets throughout. They also tend to be planned out in a way that
            the player will be running from one side and back many times, making the map feel even bigger than it
            is. But soon I realised why they chose procedural maps. Running through the same map over and over
            again would be unbearable. Whereas procedural maps help break up the monotony by mixing up the template
            every time. This also helps to keep the player on his toes, because you can't remember a path to the
            end, you'll be force to improvise at every turn.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. The permadeath in the games isn't 100% permanent. Motion Twin realised that to keep the game
            interesting, they would have to include progression in the game, but progression in a permadeath game
            can feel quite pointless, after all, you'll lose your shiny sword when you die so why bother, right?
            Well that's where the cells come in; they're like souls from Dark Souls and act like a currency that
            you can buy permanent upgrades with; stuff like new weapons and more health potions. This helps with
            the pacing as dying will feel less of a setback and more like another chance to go further.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            What Motion Twin is that permadeath like any other mechanic or feature can be made fun and iteresting - as
            long as you tailor your game towards those mechanics or features and not add them as an afterthought. So I
            guess what this article highlights is just how important it is to plan out your project in advance, and
            really thinking about the impact of every single thing you add in.
