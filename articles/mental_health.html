        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
            Mental health in media has been misrepresented for a long time now, for example, most villains in both
            movies and games tend to have some sort of mental health issue and because of this, a lot of people
            perceive think that people with mental health problems tend to be violent or dangerous which just isn't
            true.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, we have seen both moviess and games being praised for their portrayals of characters
            with mental health problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to have a look at both the best and worst that movies and games have to offer when it comes to
            mental health to see if the portrayals are accurate and fair.

        <h3>Movies</h3>
        <p>
            Before I look at video games, I wanted to look at it's older sibling; movies because for one they've
            been around for much longer and therefore have a lot more work centered around mental health. I also
            wanted to look at movies to compare it's ability to portray mental health with video games, to see the
            strengths and weakness of the two mediums when it comes to portraying mental health.

        <h3>Psycho</h3>
        <p>
            Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho created a whole genre of movies featuring mentally disturbed and violent
            killers. In a time where movies were over-saturated by aliens and werewolves, to see a brutal killer that
            looks like any other person shocked the world. However, even though the movie was extremely successful, it
            also created a lot of stigma towards mental health disorders. It also is responsible for adding "psycho" to
            the popular vocabulary which only added onto the stigma.
