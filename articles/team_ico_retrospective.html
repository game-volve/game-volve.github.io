			<strong>Who was Team Ico?</strong>
			<p>
				Team Ico was a Japanese video game development studio led by game designer Fumito Ueda. It was part of
				Sony Interactive Entertainment Japan Studio's Product Development Department #1.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most importantly, they're the people who developed
				<a class="link black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ico">ICO</a>, and
				<a class="link black" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/shadow-of-the-colossus-ps4/">Shadow of Colossus</a>
				for the PS2, which are some of the most influential games ever created.
			</p>
			<p>
				The created of Dark Souls, Hidetaka Miyazaki said that <span class="yellow">"Ico awoke me to the
				possibilities of the medium"</span> in a
				<a class="link black" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/31/bloodborne-dark-souls-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-interview">Guardian interview</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you've played either of the games, the first thing you'll notice is just how minimalistic they are.
				So what is about these humble games that makes them favourites amongst game designers?

			<strong>Design by subtraction</strong>
			<p>
				In ICO, the whole game revolves around a boy and a girl, you control the boy Ico and help the girl Yorda
				escape a castle. As you progress you'll have to solve puzzles, and fight shadow enemies using a
				stick or a sword. The whole game feels quite bare-bones, and at the same time quite unique because games
				like it didn't exist at the time; there was no Journey or Limbo.
			</p>
			<p>
				The minimalism was a conscious decision however, a design philosophy Ueda would later call
				<span class="yellow">"design by subtraction"</span>. When Ico was still being made for the
				<a class="black link" href="https://youtu.be/IQrC6JCHsic">PS1</a>,
				It had a huge world that included a village and a forest, it had many characters and a complex combat
				system. These elements were scrapped however, not because of hardware limitation or lack of time, but
				because those elements didn't reflect the core of the game.
			</p>
			<p>
				What design by subtraction asks you to do, is to look hard at the game; at it's mechanics and to ask
				yourself if those mechanics help convey your message. If they don't, then you remove them, no matter how
				much time you spent because they'll dilute the experience. Does Assassin's Creed really need a tower
				defense section?
			</p>
			<p>
				Phil Fish (the designer of <a class="black link" href="http://www.fezgame.com/">FEZ</a>) said that
				<span class="yellow">
					"It gave me the strength to butcher my own game, and every time I did the game got better for it,
					tighter, more streamlined."
				</span> in an
				<a class="black link" href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/127312/How_Polytrons_Fez_Was_Inspired_By_Uedas_Ico.php">interview</a>
				with Gamasutra.
			</p>
			<hr class="borderYellow">
			<p>
				On the other hand, you don't want to go overboard with the philosophy and remove all of the mechanics.
				The combat in Ico is very simplistic and at times it can get boring. Even Ueda said that if he was to
				go back he would improve it.
			</p>
			<strong>Conclusion</strong>
			<p>
				What I'm trying to say is that stepping back and asking yourself if that mechanic is really worth it
				might help your game convey its message.
