            <strong>Introduction</strong>
            <p>
                Multiplayer is everywhere these days, finding a person who has't player Mario Kart, or Fortnite is
                almost impossible these days. Multiplayer revolutionised gaming when it was first introduced and I'm
                sure that it's going to carry on shaping the way we interact through video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to explore where multiplayer might takes us in the future, and I feel like the right place to
                start would be at the very beginning.
            </p>
            <strong>How did it start?</strong>
            <p>
                I've always thought of multiplayer as an integral part of gaming, but what I hadn't realised was just
                how prominent in the history of video games multiplayer was.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of if not the first multiplayer video games to be created was Tennis for Two, The coolest part
                is that because the game was made to be played by two people, it also makes it the first multiplayer
                game.
