        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Multiplayer is everywhere these days, finding a person who has't player Mario Kart, or Fortnite is
            almost impossible these days. Multiplayer revolutionised gaming when it was first introduced and I'm
            sure that it's going to carry on shaping the way we interact through video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to explore where multiplayer might takes us in the future, and I feel like the right place to
            start would be at the very beginning.

        <h3>How did it start?</h3>
        <p>
            I've always thought of multiplayer as an integral part of gaming, but what I hadn't realised was just
            how prominent in the history of video games multiplayer was.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of if not the first multiplayer video games to be created was Tennis for Two which came out in 1958
            and was played by two people using custom made controllers. The coolest part about the game is that not
            only is it the first multiplayer game, it is also the first video game.

        <h3>Introduction of Networking</h3>
        <p>
            While games always had a knack for bringing people together, it would all change with the introduction
            of internet. The limitation of having to be in the same room to play games disappeared, allowing for
            people countries, even oceans apart to play together as if they were sitting on the same couch.

        <p>
            <a class="greenBg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(video_game)">Spectre</a> is a computer game for the Apple Macintosh which came out in 1991. This was the first popular
            video-game with a LAN version. This game also popularised having the player's name above their
            character.
        </p>
        <p>
            As time went on, multiplayer games became more and more popular, both the original Play Station and XBOX
            came with multiplayer support - The rest as they say, is history.
        </p>

        <strong>Where is multiplayer heading?</strong>
        <p>
            While knowing the origin of key aspects of video games is important, to appreciate the effort developers
            put into and the progress that has been made since. I feel like it's just as important to look forward
            and wonder what might come next.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I was researching on new tech that was being developed for multiplayer, I came across
            <a href="https://improbable.io/spatialos"><mark class="greenBg">Spatial OS</mark></a>
            which is a multiplayer solution made by
            <a href="https://improbable.io"><mark class="greenBg">Improbable</mark></a>.
            The reason that I think Spatial OS will change how we
            play together, and also the whole industry, is because of what Spatial OS can do - or rather what it can make
            your games do - which is to have multiplier lobbies with the player count in the hundreds of thousands.
        </p>
        <p>
            To put that into perspective, Battlefield 1 which is one of the biggest AAA first person shooter is limited
            to a lobby of 64 players. The coolest thing is that there are already
            <a href="https://improbable.io/use-cases"><mark class="greenBg">games made using Spacial OS</mark></a>.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            We've all played a game with another person which shows just how integral multiplayer has become to video games.
            Multiplayer has been around for as long as video games themselves and it has come a long way since then, but
            I think that we've still only experienced a tip of the iceberg of all that multiplayer has to offer and I hope
            that more games take advantage of Spacial OS.
