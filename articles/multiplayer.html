			<strong>Introduction</strong>
			<p>
				Multiplayer is everywhere these days, finding a person who has't player Mario Kart, or Fortnite is
				almost impossible these days. Multiplayer revolutionised gaming when it was first introduced and I'm
				sure that it's going to carry on shaping the way we interact through video games.
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to explore where multiplayer might takes us in the future, and I feel like the right place to
				start would be at the very beginning.
			</p>
			<strong>How did it start?</strong>
			<p>
				I've always thought of multiplayer as an integral part of gaming, but what I hadn't realised was just
				how prominent in the history of video games multiplayer was.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of if not the first multiplayer video games to be created was Tennis for Two which came out in 1958
				and was played by two people using custom made controllers. The coolest part about the game is that not
				only is it the first multiplayer game, it is also the first video game.
			</p>
			<strong>Introduction of Networking</strong>
			<p>
				While games always had a knack for bringing people together, it would all change with the introduction
				of internet. The limitation of having to be in the same room to play games disappeared, allowing for
				people countries, even oceans apart to play together as if they were sitting on the same couch.

			<p>
				Spectre is a computer game for the Apple Macintosh which came out in 1991. This was the first popular
				video-game with a LAN version. This game also popularised having the player's name above their
				character.
			</p>
			<p>
				As time went on, multiplayer games because more and more popular, both Play Station and XBOX came with
				multiplayer support. The rest as they say, is history.
